# Discord Bot

This is a template for a Discord bot using Python.

To use this bot, you need to visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot, and obtain its token.

Additionally, to use the weather-related commands, you will need your own API key. In this code, I use an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Create an account there to get your API key, then replace the placeholder in `weather.py`.

You can also customize the bot's command prefix to whatever you prefer!

All your API keys and URLs are stored in a `.env` file. You will need to create this file and configure it accordingly.

### Example `.env` File

```
BOT_COMMAND_PREFIX=!
BOT_AUTHORIZE_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API
OPENWEATHERMAP_BASE_URL=http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
TIMEANDDATE_BASE_URL=https://www.timeanddate.com/weather
```


Once your `.env` file is set up, load it in your code using `dotenv`, and you're good to go.

You can add this bot to your community server or personal server for fun and functionality.
