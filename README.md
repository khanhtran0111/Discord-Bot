# Discord-Bot

Hi, this is a template Discord bot using Python.

To use this bot, you have to go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new Bot, and get the Token code.

Beside, to use weather commands, you should have your own API key.
In this code, i use API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), create your account and get API key. Then replace it in `weather.py`.

You can change command prefix to whatever you want!

All your api keys, https link will be saved in .env fle, so you have to create it by your self, then configure it.

For example, this is `.env` file template:

```
BOT_COMMAND_PREFIX=!
BOT_AUTHORIZE_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API
OPENWEATHERMAP_BASE_URL=http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
TIMEANDDATE_BASE_URL=https://www.timeanddate.com/weather
```

Then, if you want to create another function, use this `.env`, load it in env.py then you can run.

You can add it to your community server or your own server to use it.

## Functions of the bot
