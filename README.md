# Discord-Bot

Hi, this is a template Discord bot using Python.

To use this bot, you have to go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new Bot, and get the Token code.

Then, go to `env.py` in the **config** file, change `YOUR_TOKEN` to your Bot's token. After that step, you can run main.py and enjoy!

You can change command prefix to whatever you want!
```
BOT_AUTHORIZE_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
BOT_COMMAND_PREFIX="!"
```

You can add it to your community server or your own server to use it.

## Functions of the bot

My bot has some functions to support users in the server.

I'm updating my code every month, so maybe you'll see some new functions ðŸ¤”

### Note
